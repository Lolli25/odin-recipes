        <h2 id="description">Spicy Hamburger Soup</h2>
        <p>Spicy hamburger soup is a hearty, rich, and flavorful soup made with ground beef, potatoes, and veggies in a spicy tomato beef broth.</p>
        <p>This soup is an easy one-pot meal that is great for emptying the produce bin. The best thing about soup is that you don't <em>have</em> to
        follow the recipe exactly. You can add whatever vegetables you like and leave out any vegetables that you don't like. Personally, I add carrots, 
         potatoes and onions because that's what my family will eat!</p>

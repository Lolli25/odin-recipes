        <h2 id="description">The <em>Best</em> Cookies</h2>
        <p>This is, by far, the best chocolate chip cookie recipe I've ever made. Everyone loves them, even those who claim they <em>"don't like cookies"</em>.
        The base cookie recipe is fantastic to use with other add-ins, such as M&Ms, butterscotch chips, white chocolate chips, and any other candy you might find in the baking aisle.</p>
        <p>I originally made these cookies to give away to friends, but my significant other tried them and immediatly laid claim to the entire batch <em>and</em> all future cookies from our kitchen. He said, <strong><em>"I'm not sharing my cookies! They can have the Oreos..."</strong></em></p>
        <h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>

                <li>4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 Tbsp + 1 tsp corn starch</li>
                <li>2 tsp baking soda</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
                <li>2 cups chocolate chips</li>
            </ul>
        <h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large mixing bowl, add butter and cream cheese. With an electric hand mixer, or a stand mixer, mix until well creamed; 3-5 minutes <em>(This is your wet mix)</em></li>
                <li>Add brown sugar and granulated sugar and mix until light and fluffy.</li>
                <li>Add two eggs and mix until eggs are incorporated.</li>
                <li>Scrape down the sides of bowl.</li>
                <li>In a separate bowl, combine flour, corn starch, baking soda, and salt.</li>
                <li>Add dry ingredients into the went mixture, thoroughly mix.*</li>
                <li>Mix in chocolate chips.</li>
                <li>Refrigerate dough for at least 1 hour*, up to 5 days.</li>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350&#176F.</li>
                <li>On a parchment-lined baking sheet, place cookie dough balls two inches apart.</li>
                <li>Bake for 8-10 minutes. Let rest on cookie sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a cooling rack.</li>
            </ol>
        <h2>Notes*</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>I find it easiest to mix the dry ingredients by hand in place of an electric mixer so I don't end up in a flour dust cloud.</li>
                <li>This step <em>can</em> be skipped, however, the cookies will spread and end up thin and flat.</li>
            </ul>

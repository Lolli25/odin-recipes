        <h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>280 grams bread flour</li>
                <li>180 grams whole wheat flour</li>
                <li>250 grams sourdough starter</li>
                <li>12 grams salt</li>
                <li>35 grams coconut sugar</li>
                <li>225 to 275 grams water</li>
                <li>20 grams cinnamon</li>
                <li>190 grams raisins</li>
                <li>180 grams maple syrup</li>
                <li>15 grams butter</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 id="Instructions">Make the Dough the Night Before</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Before going to bed, mix the two flours, starter, salt, coconut sugar, and water into a nice smooth dough.
                     Knead the dough until it's elastic and pulls away clean. It can be done by hand if that's what you prefer.
                      But a stand mixer is easier and faster.</li>
                <li>Cover the dough and let it rise overnight.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2 id="instructions">The Next Morning</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Flour your work surface. Pull the dough out of the bowl and gently shape it into a rectangle on the floured surface. 
                Turn the dough over and make sure both sides have just enough flour so that they don't stick to your work surface. 
                If you use too much flour here your bread will not roll up nicely, so be careful not to go overboard.
                 Roll the dough out with a rolling pin into a large flat sheet about 1/2 inch thick. Evenly spread the cinnamon and raisins over the dough, 
                 right up to the edge. Drizzle the maple syrup over the dough but don't go all the way to the edge — leave about 2 inches of space for the syrup to
                  expand while forming the loaf. Start at the top of the dough and roll it toward yourself, gently patting the dough down as you go. 
                Once the dough is in a tight log fold both ends over to the middle third. Roll the loaf gently to help it seal.</li>
                <li>Melt 1 tablespoon of butter in your loaf pan and put the loaf in upside down. 
                    Flip the loaf over so now the top is buttery too. Cover the loaf and let it rise until at least doubled in size. 
                    I let mine rise for about 4 hours before baking</li>
                <li>Bake the bread at 400°F for 30 minutes. Remove the bread from the pan and let it cool completely on a rack before slicing.</li>
            </ol>
